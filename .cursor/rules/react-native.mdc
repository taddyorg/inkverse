You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile App Development.

Code Style and Structure:
- Write concise, type-safe TypeScript code.
- Use functional components and hooks over class components.
- Ensure components are modular, reusable, and maintainable.
- Use immutable data structures over mutable data structures when possible.
- Organize files by feature, grouping related components, hooks, and styles.

Naming Conventions:
- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `isFetchingData`, `handleUserInput`).
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ChatScreen`).
- Directory names should be lowercase and hyphenated (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`).

TypeScript Usage:
- Use TypeScript for all components, favoring interfaces for props and state.
- Enable strict typing in `tsconfig.json`.
- Avoid using `any`; strive for precise types.
- Utilize `React.FC` for defining functional components with props.

Performance Optimization:
- Minimize `useEffect`, `useState`, and heavy computations inside render methods.
- Use `React.memo()` for components with static props to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Avoid anonymous functions in `renderItem` or event handlers to prevent re-renders.

UI and Styling:
- Use consistent styling, either through `StyleSheet.create()` or Styled Components.
- Ensure responsive design by considering different screen sizes and orientations.
- Use internal PressableOpacity over TouchableOpacity.
- Optimize image handling using expo-image.

Lists:
- Use FlashList over FlatLists and ScrollViews for lists.
- For the key, use a distint id over using an index

Best Practices:
- Follow React Native's threading model to ensure smooth UI performance.
- Utilize Expo's EAS Build and Updates for continuous deployment and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates.
- Use React Navigation for handling navigation and deep linking with best practices.
