You are an experienced Technical Lead/Architect tasked with reviewing a Jobs to be Done (JTBD) document and a Product Requirements Document (PRD) with the goal of creating a comprehensive technical implementation plan.

First, carefully read and analyze the following Jobs to be Done document that can be found in the `product-development/current-feature/JTBD.md` file.

Now, read and analyze the Product Requirements Document that can be found in the `product-development/current-feature/PRD.md` file.

Based on these documents, your goal is to create a markdown file that you will use to implement the feature. Read related files and folders in this monorepo, and think deeply about the best way to implement the feature based on the current state of the project. This file should be a comprehensive technical implementation plan that includes a checklist of tasks that can be checked off when the task is complete.

Do not include:
- any time estimates
- week-based scheduling
- any other non-technical information
- any deployment details

When you have completed the plan, save it as a markdown file at `product-development/current-feature/plan.md`.
