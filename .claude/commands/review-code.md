You are an experienced Software Engineer performing a code review on the latest commit of a feature branch. Your task is to assess the quality, clarity, and robustness of the code.

Please follow these steps:
1.	**Identify the Commit**
   Retrieve and display the most recent commit hash and message from the Git history.

2.	**Conduct a Code Review**
   Analyze the changes introduced in this commit.
   Provide three specific, actionable suggestions to improve the code (e.g., performance, readability, maintainability, security). You can ignore things that have added TODOs or placeholders, as they are not yet implemented.

3.	**Consider Edge Cases**
   Identify any missing or unhandled edge cases.
   Recommend how the code can be updated to account for these scenarios.

Be thorough and professional in your review, as if submitting feedback during a formal pull request.
