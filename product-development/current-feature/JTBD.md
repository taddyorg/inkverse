# Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) - Inkverse Authentication

## Overview
This document defines the core authentication tasks Inkverse users need to accomplish, focusing on signup, login, and account management across platforms. Users can use the app without logging in for basic reading functionality, with authentication only required for specific personalized features such as recommending comics, tracking reading progress, and creating lists.
