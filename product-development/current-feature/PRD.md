# Inkverse Authentication – PRD

### TL;DR

Inkverse authentication will provide a seamless, low-friction way for users to create accounts, sign in across devices, and access personalized features without disrupting their reading experience. The system will support social login (Google, Apple) and passwordless email login via magic links, with a focus on maintaining the app's minimalist, reader-friendly approach while enabling greater personalization and cross-device continuity.

## User Experience

### Entry Point & Onboarding

- Users can access and read most content without authentication
- Authentication prompts appear when users attempt to:
  - Create a custom list
  - Save reading progress across devices
  - Access premium/early content
  - Comment or engage socially
- Soft prompts for authentication appear occasionally on the home screen or after completing multiple episodes
- First-time authentication includes minimal onboarding that highlights the benefits

### Core Experience

- **Step 1:** User is reading comics in anonymous mode
- **Step 2:** User attempts to save progress or create a list, triggering authentication prompt
- **Step 3:** User selects preferred authentication method (Apple, Google, or Email)
- **Step 4:** For social login, standard OAuth flow appears
- **Step 5:** For email, user enters email and receives magic link
- **Step 6:** Upon successful authentication, user returns to previous activity with new capabilities
- **Step 7:** Reading progress and preferences now automatically sync across devices when the user logs in elsewhere

### Advanced Features & Edge Cases

- Offline authentication support with cached tokens
- Session recovery if connection is interrupted during authentication
- Automatic token refresh when expired
- Account merging process if a user has used multiple auth methods
- Recovery options if user loses access to authentication method

### UI/UX Highlights

- Authentication modals are minimal, non-intrusive, and on-brand
- Clear visual indicators of authenticated state (subtle profile icon)
- Authentication forms follow accessibility best practices
- Responsive design ensures consistent experience across all device sizes
- Error messages are clear, helpful, and jargon-free
- Authentication UI maintains the minimalist aesthetic of the main app

## Narrative

Alex is a college student who discovers Inkverse while searching for new indie comics. They start by casually browsing some popular series without creating an account. After reading a few episodes of "Moonlight Creatures," they're hooked and want to save their progress.

When Alex taps the "Track Progress" button, a simple modal appears offering Google, Apple, or email sign-in options. Alex chooses Google, and with two taps, their account is created. A brief welcome message highlights that their reading progress will now be saved and synced across devices.

Later that week, Alex opens Inkverse on their laptop between classes. They're automatically prompted to log in with Google, and after doing so, they're right back at the exact panel where they left off in "Moonlight Creatures." Alex creates a custom list called "Fantasy Favorites" to organize the series they've discovered.

That weekend, back on their phone, all of Alex's lists and progress have seamlessly synced. When they discover a premium episode is available early with FastPass, they feel confident making the purchase because they're already securely logged in. The entire experience feels fluid, with authentication enhancing rather than interrupting their reading experience.
